The subdirectory urjtag/ of the UrJTAG package contains a branch that is used
for the conversion of UrJTAG to a library plus a separate command shell.
Changes and commits to this branch will be frequent, and will affect nearly
every aspect of the source tree, like file names, file locations, code layout,
and identifier names.

Until further notice this branch should be considered completely unstable, to
the extent that execution or even compilation may be broken. If you want to
use UrJTAG, please use the version contained in directory ../jtag/. It
contains the version released as 0.10 plus bug fixes.
